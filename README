==Welcome to Testing-Grounds==

This is a testing rails app that was built from the ground up to give you a place where you could test out various plugins tools and stuff that you can get for rails.

===Rails Footnotes===
Author: JoseValim
Location: GitHub (http://github.com/josevalim/rails-footnotes)
Version: 3.6.7

If you are developing in Rails you should know the plugin! It displays
footnotes in your application for easy debugging, such as sessions,
request parameters, cookies, filter chain, routes, queries, etc.

Even more, it contains links to open files directly in your editor including
your backtrace lines.
